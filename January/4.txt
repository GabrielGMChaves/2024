Day 4 - 04/01/2024

Things are getting more interesting by the day!
I've finished the NumPy session from the video and watched half of the Pandas one. 
The mission tomorrow is to finish the Pandas session and start learning Matplotlib.

Things I've learned today:
- How to extract numbers from an array by their indexes.
- How to reshape multidimensional arrays.
- How to stack arrays vertically and horizontally.
- The basics about Pandas' Series and Dataframes.

Nice! :)
