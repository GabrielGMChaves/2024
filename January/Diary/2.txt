Day 2 - 02/01/2024

Today I've chose to start my study session following this video by freeCodeCamp, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHBE6Q9XlzI&t=24770s).
I've re-learned the basics about Python, installed Anaconda on my computer and wrote a few lines of code.
The plan tomorrow is to keep on watching the video and complete the NumPy tutorial.
Today was a good day :)
