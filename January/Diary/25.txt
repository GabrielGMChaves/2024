Day 24 - 24/01/2024

Today I've watched some more videos from the Google Data Analytics course, here's what I've learned:

The 5 aspects of analytical thinking:

-Visualization
-Strategy
-Problem-orientation
-Correlation
-Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

Ask "why" 5 times to draw better conclusions of the root cause.

Ask - Prepare - Process - Analyze - Share - Act

Ask: Understand the root cause and indentify the problems that need to be fixed.

Prepare: Collect, extract and store useful data.

Process: Clean, transform and combine meaningful data.

Analyze: Use tools to transform and organize data.

Share: In this phase, data is now in its visual shape in order to be easily shared and digested.

Act: This is where the data-driven decisions are made after all the other steps.
