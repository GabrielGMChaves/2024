Day 22 - 22/01/2024

Today I've downloaded a dataframe about Youtubers and started learning more about data cleaning.
My objective is to do more research on how to clean and check the data to prepare it for the visualizations.
So far, I've detected the following problems with the dataframe:

-Youtuber column full of "Ã½" digits, which needs cleaning
-Year, day and month separated in three different columns with wrong data types
-Columns with NaN data

That's what I've found so far, I still need to find all the problems with the data to do some visualizations with it.
