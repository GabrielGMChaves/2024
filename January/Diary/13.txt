Day 13 - 13/01/2024

Today I've watched some of the videos from the Big Data & Analytics course by FIAP.
I had my first experience with R and Tableau, so my goal next week will be to dig deeper into those two.
Taking a peek at the rest of the course, it seems like I'll be able to complete it till the end of the week, so that's still my goal.
Tableau seems to be a paid software, so I'll have to work that out.
