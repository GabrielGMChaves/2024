Day 8 - 08/01/2024

Today, I've decided to practice working with datasets from Kaggle, the one that I chose today had a few issues with it, so I had to clean the data.
I've learned how to detect and delete duplicates, learned to merge multiple columns into one and to do general data cleaning.
The plan tomorrow is to keep on working with this dataset in order to create multiple visualizations from it, including:

- Times where the cars crash the most
- Locations with the most crashes
- Visualization of types of crashes
- Total crashes throughout the years
