Day 24 - 24/01/2024

Today I've started the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course.
Here's what I've learned today:

Data Analytics is the science of data, everything about data fits under the Data Analytics umbrella.

Data Analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

Data science is defined by creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.

Data scientists create new questions using data, while data analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.
