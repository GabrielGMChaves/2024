Day 6 - 06/01/2024

Today I've finished watching the freeCodeCamp tutorial and learned tons about data manipulation in Python.
I've completed a simple project, showing covid 19 stats throughout the days in many countries using a csv dataset.
Next step is to do a customized project on another theme that I'll be choosing tomorrow.
I slowly feel like this is going to work out great, it feels like I'm really learning new stuff every day.
