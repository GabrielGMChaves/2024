Day 27 - 27/01/2024

Summary of things learned today:

Before solving a problem, we need to understand it, so we don't need to start all over again.

A scope of work might be a great way to define and erase any doubts about the projects and its requirements.

Communication is key, if you feel like you might be doing something they not need, take your time to confirm wheter that's the right thing or not.

Focus on what matters, ask yourself these 3 questions:
Who are the stakeholders?
Who's managing this data?
Where can you go for help?

Solve the problem:
Who's your audience?
What they already know?
What they need to know?
How to communicate this to them effectively?

Always present clear and objective emails for better communication with the team and the stakeholders.

Meetings best practices:
Come prepared - Bring what you need, read the agenda, prepare notes, be ready to answer questions.
Be on time - Just be on time.
Pay attention - Take notes, stay on focus.
Ask questions - Ask questions to better understand what's being talked about.
