Day 23 - 23/01/2024

Today I've got the 'Ã½' digit thing fixed on the dataframe and next step is to fix the rest of the data.
I'm running a bit low of ideas on what to study next, it might be a good idea to start a new course.
That way at least I'll be for sure learning something, that Google data course has been really dragging my attention lately, mainly because it's using a new language (R) and I feel like I need to get a bit out of my comfort zone to really delve into this whole Data Science thing.
I'm really inclined to start that course this week, let's see how it goes, because it's a bit expensive (at least for me).

That's it.
