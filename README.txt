Hello, I'm Gabriel, welcome to my study portifolio for 2024. 
My plan is to use this space as something like a diary, writing and coding daily any new stuff that I decide is interesting for my career.
My main focus in this year is to learn and develop skills regarding data analysis/machine learning, so if you're reading this, feel free to send me a message with any tips or suggestions.

Rules:
- I need to keep updating this each day of the year.
- I need to develop relevant projects (at least 1 per month).
- I need to consider this as my main focus, as it is not an easy task.

With that in mind, let's go!
