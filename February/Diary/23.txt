Day 54 - 23/02/2024

Work done!
I've completed the Python code that basically does what the one on my gym do.
It checks constantly for a face on the screen and when it finds one, it checks wheter it is on the img database or not.
When it finds somebody who is in the database, it lets the person in.
The code needs some more cleaning and I could probably have done some better stuff with the visuals but I've figured I won't spend more time on it since I feel like I've learned what I needed.

Also spent some time learning about Grafana and Metabase.
