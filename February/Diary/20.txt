Day 51 - 20/02/2024

Today I've fixed all 3 codes, cleaned them the best as I could and they're now ready to be used.
They're all simple projects, made only to explore the uses of DeepFace, which can analyze, find and extract emotions from faces using ML models.
From tomorrow on, I'll be focusing on learning some more about ML and how to actually build a model that learns about something and produces valuable output.
