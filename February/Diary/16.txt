Day 47 - 16/02/2024

Today I've made a couple of visualizations about how much we're able to collect at average on each moon of the game and found out which where the most lucrative an which were the least.
The task tomorrow is to complete these visualizations and develop a general score system for each moon, that takes into consideration both risk and profit on each moon so I can finally find out which are the best.
