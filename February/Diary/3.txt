Day 34 - 03/02/2024

Unfortunately I forgot to complete my task to post what I did yesterday, but that does not mean that I've forgot to study.
I spent most of my time yesterday and today completing the challenge, which was basically to get a dataset, use the OpenAI playground to read a csv file and retrieve info for each line on the dataset, then, inside their system develop some visualizations for the extracted and transformed data.

It was really good to participate in such challenge, because I learned more about APIs and how to use them in Python to retrieve and send information.
