Day 32 - 1/02/2024

Today my task was to complete the challenge I first started yesterday, but unfortunately I wasn't able to complete it.
Tomorrow I'll keep on trying to complete it, but if I can't is okay, since it is a mid level challenge (I'm still a Junior).
Looking on the bright side of things, I've learned some stuff about APIs and json.
