Day 74 - 14/03/2024

Felling way better today, spent some time learning about variables, logical operators, conditional operators and some functions in R, here are some that I can remember:

c() creates a vector
list() creates a list
matrix() creates a matrix
print() prints text
* - + /
& | ! AND, OR, NOT
x <- creates a variable
class(x) returns data type
== != > < >= <=

if () { 	} else
