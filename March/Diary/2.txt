Day 62 - 02/03/2024

Today I've completed another module from the course and spent some time studying some visualizations to learn from them.
I've learned that we need to pay close attention to our stakeholders and build the whole data storytelling in a way that our target audience is able to easily digest.
Whenever we're doing a visualization, we need to think what message and what story do we want to share from it.
We also should try to narrow the visualization to only include what's needed and requested from our stakeholders, so we avoid confusion or misunderstandings.
It's a good idea to include only five lines and 25 words per slide in our presentations, so we can keep on focus what's being discussed without boring or confusing our audience.
My focus tomorrow will be to finish this Module, that's it.
